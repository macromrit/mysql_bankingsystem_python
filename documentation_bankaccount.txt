               DOCUMENTATION:

                ^Title: Banckaccount Software
                
                ^Core Programming Language: Python
                
                ^Database used: Mysql(via mysql.connector)
                
                ^Programmer's name: C.Amrit Subramanian(a.k.a: Macromrit)

                ^Agenda:
                    -> To make the software user-friendly.
                    -> software shouldn't throw errors, if input ain't the type it wants .
                    -> software gotta have a menu to create delete and potray the history of users, for the bank it tires.
                    -> should have deposit and withdraw features.
                    -> should accomidate transcation aspects.i.e transferring funds from a user to another.
                    -> should validate users(via username and passcode).. if a user wants to terminate or continue a process via his/her account.
                    -> gotta make the output pretty and graceful to inherit a bankish(is that a word :), hopefully! ya got what I'm trying to convey) ambience.
                    -> to make the code non-tedious and tiny.. gonna use functions for all the major, fundamental features.

                
                ^flaws to refrain:
                    -> should never ever forget about adding the commit function after database manipulation.
                    -> gotta be skeptical about if else statments .
                    -> should be judicious regarding try except errors.
                    -> should make the database well secured to avoid and be resilient while hackers are try to inject it.

                
                ^Major functions that should be professed by the software:
                    -> user-signup ^
                    -> user-termination ^
                    -> user-transactions ^
                    -> user-history potrayal ^

                ^server side missions[these should me made right befor running the program in your P.C(personal computer)]:
                    table name: bankaccount
                    table inherited by "BANKACCOUNT" database

                    table1] 
                    name: bankusers_main
                    table incorporated elements :
                        -> name varchar(80)
                        -> passcode varchar(50)
                        -> used_id char(10)
                        -> balance FLOAT
                        -> date_created TIMESTAMP PRIMAY KEY

                    table1] 
                    name: bankusers_history
                    table incorporated elements :

                        -> with_depo varchar(20)
                        -> ticky TIMESTAMP PRIMARY KEY
                        -> amount FLOAT

                ^Workon Guide(How To use this software):
                    -> basically its a menu driven program.
                    -> start by inputing 'C' if you haven't registered an account under your name yet.
                    -> after creating an account, it would potray ya a recipt based output where ya should remember the unique id that the software provides 
                    -> after roting your id.. kick off with other assortments, which the software offers.
                    -> well smash it up.. Good Luck.. Thanks for supporting
